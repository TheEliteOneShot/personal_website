Wrote the backend in FASTAPI.
Wrote the frontend in VueJS3 with a Premium Template.
Custom created a mini identity server integration with backend and frontend.
Docker Ready, and also added a Reverse Proxy to hide the Backend for a potential docker implementation.

Personally wrote the Frontend and Backend implementation including:

- Account Creation
- Login
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Access Token
- Refresh Token
- Database Integration

- For example, custom wrote the *frontend/src/composable/useApi.ts* in JavaScript. This AXIOS implementation handles the API calls when the Access Token has expired to request to Refresh Token from the Fast API backend, among several other things.

Customized several VueJS3 templates.
